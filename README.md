# Project Title:	We’re doing it in C++

# Team Name:
* Lexi Vessels
* Alan Jeanpierre
* Eduardo Mata
* Hector Flores

# Proposed Project
We will implement the K-means, Agnes, and DBSACN clustering algorithms. We will do it in C++ without any external libraries for portability. We will test our algorithms against both sk-learn and WEKA’s implementations. 

# Datasets
* We will use simple ‘hello world’ type of datasets, such as the Iris dataset or BUPA dataset, along with generated data from sk-learn.
  * Iris: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris 
  * BUPA: ftp://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/machine-learning-databases/liver-disorders  

# Project Timeline
* March 2, 2018 -- Turn in proposal
* March 7, 2018 -- Meet to discuss progress and work on algorithms
* March 21, 2018 -- Meet to discuss progress and test algorithms
* March 28, 2018 -- Meet to discuss progress and prepare progress report 
* March 30, 2018 -- Turn in progress report
* April 4, 2018 -- Hopefully finished with project by now and begin working on final presentation and paper

# Milestones
* Find datasets to test accuracy of algorithms.
* Research algorithms
* Implement algorithms
* Test and Re-factor algorithms as much as necessary
